# Lesson 5.1: Intro to Cloning

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Explain why prototyping and clones can be useful.
* Describe how complex goals can be accomplished using cloning.

## Materials/Preparation

* [Unit 5 Tips](unit_5_tips.md.html)
* [5.1 Slide Deck](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/slidedecks/TEALS%20SNAP%205.1.pptx)
* [Lab 5.1 Handout Connect the Dots](lab_51.md.html) ([docx](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%205%20Word/Lab%205.1%20Connect%20the%20Dots.docx)) ([pdf](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/Unit%205%20PDF/Lab%205.1%20Connect%20the%20Dots.pdf))
* If possible, create large poster-sized versions of the dot grids (each grid is 12 x 3).

| 10 minutes | Introduce activity |
| 25 minutes | Activity |
| 15 minutes | Debrief and wrap-up|

## Instructor's Notes

### Introduce activity

* Inform students that they will be drawing some figures by following specific instructions
* Emphasize that students must follow all instructions in the lab carefully
* Throughout the activity, ask students to think about other ways they could accomplish the same goals and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

### Activity

* Split students into diverse groups of at least six.  If the number of students is not an exact multiple of six, create a few groups of seven and have students take turns being "active."
* Students should follow the steps in the lab, being careful to act as a group.
* In each part, the group will draw the letter 'C' six times, using slightly different instructions.
* Students should, hopefully, notice that in part 3, they are able to achieve similar but not exactly the same results by all following the same instructions.  (Though each student draws a 'C', they are not all in the same location.)  In each part, they were able to improve the efficiency and clarity of the instructions.

### Debrief

* Ask each group to share their answers to the questions at the end of each part.
* Discuss how this approach could be applied to coding.
* Introduce the terms **prototyping** and **cloning** as (mostly) synonyms:
* **prototyping:** creating a single "master" entity that defines the behavior for a group of objects, then creating many copies of the prototype to duplicate the behavior
