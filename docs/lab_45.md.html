# It's Around Here Somewhere

In this lab, you will implement several custom blocks performing variants of sequential search.

## Part 1: You There

1. Write your own version of the Snap! `contains` block, which takes a list and a value as arguments. Then reports true if the value is in the list and reports false otherwise.  You should NOT use the existing `contains` block in your implementation.

## Part 2: Where

1. Write a custom block called "index of" that takes a list and a value as arguments and reports the index of the value found in the list.  If the value is not in the list, report -1.

## Part 3: Tell Me More

1. Write a custom block called "first e-word" that takes a list as an argument and reports the first word in the list that starts with the letter 'e'.  If no such word exists, report a blank (nothing).

2. BONUS: Write a custom block called "first word that starts with" that takes a list and a letter as arguments, and reports the first word in the list that starts with the given letter.  If no such word exists, report a blank (nothing).
