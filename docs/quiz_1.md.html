# Unit 1 Quiz Snap! Basics

## Learning Objectives

Formative assessment on student progress: To gauge student understanding, the addition of Unit quizzes has been added.  These are intended as low stakes formative assessments that allow students to visit topics at the end of the unit to reinforce learning.  They are open book giving students incentive to take good notes.  Ideally the quizzes are non-graded and students would reflect on the answers they got wrong in order to learn from their mistakes.

## Materials/Preparation

- TEALS Classes can access the Quizzes by logging into the TEALS Dashboard and navigating to "Additional Curriculum Materials" -> "Intro CS Curriculum".
- You will need to log in using incognito mode on the browser.
- See [Additional Curriculum Resources](additional_curriculum_resources.md.html) for further instructions.
