# Do Now 0.04 I am

How would you fill in the following: I am ______?

This could be answered in many ways:

1. What you enjoy doing: I am a musician.
2. Physically: I am tall.
3. Personal characteristic: I am funny.
4. Career aspirations: I am an engineer.
5. Self reflective: I am a deep thinker.
6. As an athlete: I am a runner.

And this is just the beginning.  

After taking few minutes to think who you are, write down a few.  We will be using who you are to write a Snap! self expression program.
